# VRPython

## A Python tool designed to solve Vehicle Routing and Traveling Salesman Problems

The main purpose of VRPython is to be an easy-to-use solving tool for different versions of Vehicle Routing Problems, including the one-vehicle case, which can be identified as the Traveling Salesman Problem. To reach this goal, we are developing a multi-classes framework, where the user can import just the solver needed to face the problem, and setting just some hyperparameters (if wanted). It can be used to research purposes too, being an easy tool to run from classic models to modern heuristics, but different from other similar packages, the objective of VRPython is to be used by non Operations Research specialists too, and so some MIP/CP modelling tools may be not very immediate.

At this moment we are developing it totally in Python, focusing in keeping it user-friendly and as fast as possible. We consider the possible need to add some C/C++ extensions, depending on performance needs.
