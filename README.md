# VRPython
### A Python tool designed to solve Vehicle Routing and Traveling Salesman Problems.

The main purpose of VRPython is to be an easy-to-use solving tool for different versions of Vehicle Routing Problems, including the one-vehicle case, which can be identified as the Traveling Salesman Problem. The structure of VRPython is based on the SciKit Learn structure, that is, a multi-classes framework, where the user can import just the solver needed to face the problem, and setting just some hyperparameters (if wanted). It can be used to research purposes too, being an easy tool to run from classic models to modern heuristics, but different from other similar frameworks on Internet, the objective of VRPython is to be used by non Operations Research specialists too, and so some MIP/CP modelling tools may be not very immediate. 

The development goal is to have a powerful multi-task tool totally built in Python, but some C/C++ extensions may be added in the future, depending on the occurrence of performance needs.
